Weather Greeting Application

This project demonstrates how to use Python to create web applications. It is primarily meant for educational purposes, specifically created for the WorldQuant University - Introduction to Data Science Module.

The skills and tools used are:

    Python's requests package.
    Python's flask web framework.
    working with JSON.
    modular programming.

When a client visits the application, it:

    gets the client's IP address.
